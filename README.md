# Welcome to the home of the Integrated Bioinformatics course

This is the material that goes with the manuscript 'An educational guide for Nanopore sequencing in the classroom' and that forms the basis for the Bioinformatics (NB2161) course taught at TU Delft.

This repository contains detailed instructions for students and educators.

Furthermore we provide an up-to-date VM image that can be used by students:
